Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Halfway through developing our first idea, we realized that it would be too much to handle and that not much of it would be finished. We changed Ideas to a discord bot that will function like a Pokémon Pokédex.

With the discord bot, I have the base code of it running and some code so that you can put in a small command so that the bot can recognize that you're searching for a dex entry. I also have some Pokémon in there as well.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't figured out how to have the Discord bot run on its own yet. I also haven't added as many Pokémon to the dex as I wanted.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The main problem would be time. Since we've changed project ideas decently late, it has become almost like a time crunch to finish it.
